## Dependencies

+ Keras
+ Pandas
+ Matplotlib
+ Numpy
+ OpenCV
+ SKlearn

## Usage

### Clone this repository

Type the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/directory/
git clone https://github.com/pieaisv/Self_Driving-Cars-Worshop
cd Self_Driving_Car/
```

### Run the pretrained model

Start up the [Udacity self-driving simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python Drive.py
```
## Dataset
The model is train using udacity simulator self driving car training mode and after that i have trained my model on that dataset for convenience you can use my data to train ur model [here]
